### Clothing
Manitoba summers can be unpredictable so we encourage you to bring the following:

- Sweater/hoodie for later in the evening
- Rain poncho and/or umbrella in the case of an unexpected shower
- Mosquito repellant

### Seating
Some grandstand and bench seating is available. If you wish to sit closer to the stage, you'll need to bring lawnchairs and possibly blankets to sit on.

### Miscellaneous
While Oak Valley has taken various measures to mitigate the inevitable mosquitos that populate the great outdoors, we recommend that you bring mosquito repellant. Generally the pests only come out once the production is over and you're on the way back to the parking lot.
