- testimonial_content: We have attended our church services each year for many years...have
    watched movies about the story of Christ's death and resurrection, but never before
    have we actually felt like we were a part of Christ's story of who He was, how
    He and His mother and disciples and others acted and reacted. Thank you for the
    moving and beautiful portrayal of this most important story.
