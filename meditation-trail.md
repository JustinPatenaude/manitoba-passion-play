Whether you've come for the Passion Play or just visiting the site on a summer afternoon, spend some time in prayer and reflection on our meditation trail.
 
Modeled after the 14 Stations of the Cross, each waypoint provides opportunity for quiet worship in the beauty of God's creation.
 
Please wear appropriate footwear, respect the environment and other hikers, and stay on the path.
 
Trails may be too rigorous for some.
 
If you're here for the Passion Play, come early to place your lawnchairs and go for a hike.
 
Allow a minimum of 20 minutes to complete the entire trail.
