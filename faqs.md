##### Aren't there lots of mosquitoes in the Valley?
We have found that even on warm July nights, the pesky little Manitoba residents only show themselves later in the evening. So you may still want to bring some repellant but you'll only need it on the way back to your vehicle after the performance.

##### What happens if it rains?
We've rarely had to cancel a performance for rain. There may be a delay or two but July showers are usually brief and serve to remind us that we're in God's outdoor theatre.

##### What washroom facilities are available?
The site has men's and women's washrooms with hot and cold running water. We also provide additional portable toilets during performances.

##### What about animals. Is it safe?
Absolutely. You may see rabbits, chipmunks, deer, but no bears or other nasties. Our friendly volunteers will look after your travelling in and out of the site with your utmost safety in mind.

##### How many people does the site hold?
Our grassed amphitheatre can accomodate well in excess of 1000 viewers per night. Most people bring lawnchairs but there is some grandstand and bench seating available.

##### Would you recommend the production for young children?
The story is one of triumph and redemption, however Jesus did suffer greatly at the hands of the Romans and we do our best to portray this with some realism while being sensitive to our audience - in particular, younger children. We feel it is our mission to show Christ's life, death and resurrection. The forgiveness Jesus offered to his enemies even as he died is all the more amazing when we consider what he suffered.

##### How long is the play?
Running time is approx 2 1/4 hours which includes a 15 minute intermission.

##### What payment options are available on site?
On site concessions cash preferred. No debit cards accepted on site.
